I am an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science and Engineering at [IIT Ropar](https://www.iitrpr.ac.in/), with strong research interests in machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision. I am a part of the [LSAIML](https://cse.iitrpr.ac.in/ckn/index.html) team headed by [Dr. Narayanan C. K](https://cse.iitrpr.ac.in/ckn/people/ckn.html), where I work on the domains - <b> generative modeling and meta-learning</b>. I also explore <b>application of deep learning</b> to novel problems that can impact society for the better.

I am a passionate AI researcher who enjoys connecting dots and innovating ideas that span multiple disciplines. I have a strong academic background in engineering and machine learning. If you would like to collaborate, please feel free to reach out through [email](mailto:2017csb1104@iitrpr.ac.in) :mailbox_closed:. I am also presently on the look for <b>Ph.D. opportunities in AI</b>.
