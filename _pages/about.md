I am an AI resident at [Verisk Analytics](https://www.verisk.com/), with strong research interests in machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision. I completed by undergraduate studies majoring in Computer Science and Engineering from [IIT Ropar](https://www.iitrpr.ac.in/), where I was fortunate to be a part of the [LSAIML](https://cse.iitrpr.ac.in/ckn/index.html) team headed by [Dr. Narayanan C. K](https://cse.iitrpr.ac.in/ckn/people/ckn.html). I broadly work on the domains - <b> generative modeling and meta-learning</b>. I also explore <b>application of deep learning</b> to novel problems that can impact society for the better.

I am a passionate AI researcher who enjoys connecting dots and innovating ideas that span multiple disciplines. I have a strong academic background in engineering and machine learning. If you would like to collaborate, please feel free to reach out through [email](mailto:2017csb1104@iitrpr.ac.in) :mailbox_closed:. 

I am also on the look for <b>Ph.D. opportunities in AI/ML,</b>  starting Fall 2022.
