I am an AI researcher trying to make machines capable of representing knowledge while reasoning about the uncertainties in this increasingly complex world.

Presently, I am a 1<sup>st</sup> year Ph.D. student working at the [StARLing Lab](https://starling.utdallas.edu/) headed by [Dr. Sriraam Natarajan](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~sriraam.natarajan/). I work broadly in the domains of <b> Neuro-Symbolic AI</b>, <b> Probabilistic Generative Models </b> and <b> Meta-learning</b>. I also explore novel applications that can benefit from these reasearch areas, especially problems that can impact society for the better. Previously, I completed by undergraduate studies majoring in Computer Science and Engineering from [IIT Ropar](https://www.iitrpr.ac.in/), where I was fortunate to be a part of the [LSAIML](https://seekayan.github.io/) team headed by [Dr. Narayanan C. K](https://seekayan.github.io/ck.html).


I am passionate about building robust and efficient systems that can reason probabilistically and make interpretable decisions. I enjoy connecting dots and innovating ideas that span multiple disciplines. I have a strong academic background in engineering and machine learning.
