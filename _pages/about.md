I am an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science and Engineering at IIT Ropar, with strong research interests in machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision. I am a part of the LSAIML team headed by Dr. Narayanan C. K, where I work on multiple domains that include developing better algorithms for generative modeling and meta-learning and the application of deep learning to novel problems that can impact society for the better.

I am a passionate AI researcher who enjoys connecting dots and innovating ideas that span multiple disciplines. I have a strong academic background in engineering and machine learning. If you would like to collaborate, please feel free to reach out through email. I am also presently on the look for Ph.D. opportunities in AI.
